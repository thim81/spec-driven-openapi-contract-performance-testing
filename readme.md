### OpenAPI Spec-driven concept

> Congrats, you just launched ðŸš€ an API! And next the questions are pouring in: Where are the docs? How many requests per minute can it handle? Which fields are required? How to test the API? ðŸ¤”

This repo contains a proof-of-concept used during a presentation about "Unlocking the Power of Spec-Driven API Development", for the Meetup: https://www.meetup.com/php-limburg-be/events/298068752/

It provides a working Marvel API, which is used to demonstrate all the steps & benefits of Spec-Driven API Development.

The outcome of this proof-of-concept is a working API, with a full set of documentation, tests, mock server, performance tests, client SDKs, ...
